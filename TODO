- man page
- lots of testing of new features, most notably -DLARGEFILES
- thread creation overhead time should be removed from measured time.
  this however is rather small if there are not lots of threads.
- add rewrite test 
- add option to select which tests you want to run with logic
  which are the essential ones to run also to reach. ie if you want
  only seek test, writing files should still be made before them.
- add option to choose how you want to output of seek testing to appear.
  I still don't know which one is better MB/s or seeks/sec, perhaps
  even average seek time in milliseconds would be good. (miku)
